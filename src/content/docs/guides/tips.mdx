## Error: `npm run register`

Error when `register.js` cannot be executed, regardless of the success or failure of command registration.

Please consider the following modifications (Either one or a combination):

- Node.js
  - Upgrade to v23.6.0 or higher [Reference](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v23.6.0)
- package.json
  - `"type": "module",`
- tsconfig.json
  - `"moduleResolution": "Node",`
  - `"moduleResolution": "Bundler",`
- register.ts
  - Add `.js` when importing from other files  
    `import { commands } from './commands.js'`
- esbuild etc.
  - Use a bundling tool to compile `register.js` into a single file

<Aside>
  We believe this error occurs because the deployed code `index.ts` and the
  registration code `register.ts` are executed in different TypeScript compiler
  environments.
</Aside>

If you still can't resolve the issue:

- Give up on file splitting
  - Don't split `register.ts` into `commands.ts` etc.
- Create a URL endpoint for command registration
  - Use Hono or similar to create routing and a registration URL
  - As a precaution, apply [basic authentication](https://hono.dev/docs/middleware/builtin/basic-auth) or similar

## Developing with `npm run dev`

While production deployment is done on platforms like Cloudflare Workers, if you want to develop locally, please refer to [this guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/hosting-on-cloudflare-workers#running-locally).

As a library developer, we do not recommend using `npm run dev` (unless you have a specific reason to do so).  
Instead, consider one of the following alternatives:

- Create a separate Bot account for development
- Register development-only commands for your production Bot that are only available on development servers

## Error: `wrangler dev`

An error that occurs when accessing the URL endpoint for command registration in the development environment.

Try the following fixes:

- Rename the `.env` file to `.dev.vars`
- Add `.dev.vars` to `.gitignore` (if not already present)

<Aside>
  This error occurs because `wrangler dev` cannot read the `.env` file,
  resulting in environment variables not being found.
</Aside>

## Validation error when registering URL

Error when registering a URL in the INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL of the Discord dashboard.

Try the following fix:

- Change the `_` (underscore) in the URL you're registering to `-` (hyphen)
  - `aaa_bbb.user.workers.dev` -> `aaa-bbb.user.workers.dev`

## Tips for various environments (Î²)

<Aside type="caution">I have not yet been able to verify these codes.</Aside>

### Hono

```ts "hono.mount" "discord.fetch"
const discord = new DiscordHono()
discord.command('hello', c => c.res('Discord World'))

const hono = new Hono()
hono.get('/', c => c.text('Hono World'))
hono.mount('/interaction', discord.fetch)
```

- Browser
  - `https://YOUER_DOMAIN.com` -> Display: `Hono World`
- Discord Bot
  - `/hello` -> Response: `Discord World`
- Discord Interaction Endpoint
  - Register URL: `https://YOUER_DOMAIN.com/interaction`

### Deno Deploy

```ts
import { DiscordHono } from 'npm:discord-hono'

const app = new DiscordHono()
app.command('ping', c => c.res('Pong!!'))

Deno.serve(app.fetch)
```

### Fastly Compute

```ts
import { env } from 'fastly:env'
import { DiscordHono } from 'discord-hono'

const app = new DiscordHono({
  discordEnv: () => ({
    APPLICATION_ID: env('DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID'),
    PUBLIC_KEY: env('DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY'),
    TOKEN: env('DISCORD_TOKEN'),
  }),
}).command('ping', c => c.res('Pong!!'))

addEventListener('fetch', event =>
  event.respondWith(app.fetch(event.request, undefined, event)),
)
```
