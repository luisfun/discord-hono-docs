## Builder

Discord.js builders can generate raw objects by doing `.toJSON()`.  
Discord Hono accepts raw objects, so use it.

The Command Builder and Embed Builder are supported by default without `.toJSON()`.

<Aside type="caution">I have not yet been able to verify these codes.</Aside>

### Command Builder

```ts ".toJSON()"
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from '@discordjs/builders'
import { register } from 'discord-hono'

const commands = [
  new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('ping')
    .setDescription('Check if this interaction is responsive')
]

register(commands, ...)
```

### Embed Builder

```ts ".toJSON()"
import { EmbedBuilder } from '@discordjs/builders'
import { DiscordHono } from 'discord-hono'

const app = new DiscordHono().command('embed', c =>
  c.res({
    embeds: [
      new EmbedBuilder().setTitle('Title').setDescription('Description'),
    ],
  }),
)
```
