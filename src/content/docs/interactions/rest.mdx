import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

There are 4 ways to use Discord's REST API:

1. `c.rest`
2. `new Rest(c.env.DISCORD_TOKEN)`
3. Other libraries (such as [@discordjs/rest](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/rest/main))
4. Implement your own using `fetch()`

1 and 2 behave the same way.  
Since REST API is essentially separable, any implementation method is acceptable.

## About c.rest

If you're using `new Rest()`, please replace it accordingly.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Variables">

```ts
import { _channels_$_messages } from 'discord-hono'

await c.rest.post(_channels_$_messages, [channel_id], {
  content: 'this is rest',
})
//await c.rest.method(_path, ['Variables in Path'], data)
```

The first argument of the method is defined [here](https://github.com/luisfun/discord-hono/blob/main/src/rest/rest-path.ts).  
The second argument is an array of variables enclosed in `{}` in the Path.  
The third and subsequent arguments are necessary data.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Docs Path">

```ts
await c.rest.post('/channels/{channel.id}/messages', [channel_id], {
  content: 'this is rest',
})
//await c.rest.method('Path of official docs', ['Variables in Path'], data)
```

For the first argument of method, copy the Path from the [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#create-message) as is.  
The second argument is an array of variables enclosed in `{}` in the Path.  
The third and subsequent arguments are necessary data.
