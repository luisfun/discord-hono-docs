There are 4 ways to use Discord's REST API:

1. `c.rest`
2. `createRest(c.env.DISCORD_TOKEN)`
3. Other libraries (such as [@discordjs/rest](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/rest/main))
4. Implement your own using `fetch()`

1 and 2 behave the same way.  
Since REST API is essentially separable, any implementation method is acceptable.

## About c.rest

If you're using `createRest()`, please replace it accordingly.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Variables">

```ts
import { _channels_$_messages } from 'discord-hono'

await c.rest('POST', _channels_$_messages, [channel_id], {
  content: 'this is rest',
})
```

The first argument is the Method from the [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#create-message).  
The second argument is defined [here](https://github.com/luisfun/discord-hono/blob/main/src/rest/rest-path.ts).  
For the third argument, enter the variable parts enclosed in `{}` within the Path as an array.  
The fourth argument and subsequent arguments are the required data.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Docs Path">

```ts
await c.rest('POST', '/channels/{channel.id}/messages', [channel_id], {
  content: 'this is rest',
})
```

The first argument is the Method from the [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#create-message).
The second argument is the Path from the [official documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#create-message). Copy it as is.
For the third argument, input the variable parts enclosed in `{}` within the Path as an array.
The fourth argument and subsequent arguments are the necessary data.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The REST API client provided by Discord Hono is a lightweight fetch wrapper with type safety.  
Since it focuses on optimization for edge environments, complex features like automatic rate limit handling are intentionally omitted.
