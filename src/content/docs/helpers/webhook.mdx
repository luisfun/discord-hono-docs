`webhook` is a wrapper function for sending messages to [Discord Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

```ts "retry429"
import { webhook } from 'discord-hono'

await webhook('https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123/abc', 'Message')
```

<Aside>
  The `webhook` function can be used independently of a Discord Bot. It's useful
  when you want to send logs or notifications from your application to a Discord
  channel, even in projects where you haven't implemented a Discord Bot.
